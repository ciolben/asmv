This package is an implementation of the camera motion compensation introduced in our paper. This is built over dense trajectories code (v1.1) by Heng Wang.
Following files have been modified for adding motion compensation and DCS descriptor:
* DenseTrack.cpp  
* DenseTrack.h  
* Descriptors.h  
* Initialize.h


### Compiling ###

- Prerequisites:
* OpenCV library (tested with OpenCV-2.4.2)
* ffmpeg library (tested with ffmpeg-0.11.1)
* boost libraries (tested with boost_1_49_0)
* Motion2D
  - Download motion2D from http://www.irisa.fr/vista/Motion2D/ and intall it.
  - Update in DenseTrack.cpp the variable 'motion2D_path' with the path to 'Motion2D' binary.
	-> char motion2D_path[] = "~/src/Video/bin/Motion2D";

Simply make to compile the code, if the above libraries are installed correctly it will go smooth. The executable will be in the directory './release/'.


### Checking installation ###

Refer to README_Wang to check if:
* test video decoding is fine; and
* compute and compare features with those computed by Heng Wang.
(By default it exactly runs as dense trajectory) 


### Using w-flow for compensated features ###

We have added three options related to our contribution: 
* -T : set to compute w-features.
* -C : set to compute DCS.
* -M : set to estimate and save affine motion model.

First, run code with -M 1 passing the path where you wish to save motion model and extracted frames, e.g.

./release/DenseTrack ./test_sequences/person01_boxing_d1_uncomp.avi  person01_boxing_d1_uncomp -M 1

This saves motion model 'AC.mod' and frames in directory 'person01_boxing_d1_uncomp'.

Once the model file is saved w-flow features can be computed as:
				
./release/DenseTrack <video>  < model_path>  -T 1  -C 0  |  gzip  >  wFlow_out.features.gz
For example:
./release/DenseTrack ./test_sequences/person01_boxing_d1_uncomp.avi  person01_boxing_d1_uncomp  -T 1  -C 0  |  gzip  >  wFlow_out.features.gz

This will compute:  trajectory descriptor, HOG, HOF, HOF from w-Flow, MBH from w-Flow		# note w-HOF := HOF and HOF from w-Flow combined
You can compare model file person01_boxing_d1_uncomp/AC.mod with test_sequences/person01_boxing_d1_uncomp/AC.mod and wFlow_out.features.gz with test_sequences/wFlow_person01_boxing_d1.gz.

'-C 1' computes DCS decriptor using optical flow (-T 0) or w-Flow (-T 1)
