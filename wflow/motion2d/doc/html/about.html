<h1> About Motion2D </h1><br>

<p>

<p>
<br>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Motion2D is a multi-platform object-oriented library to estimate 2D parametric motion models in an image sequence. It can handle several types of motion models, namely, constant (translation), affine, and quadratic models. Moreover, it includes the possibility of accounting for a global variation of illumination. The use of such motion models has been proven adequate and efficient in issues such as optic flow computation, motion segmentation, detection of independent moving objects, object tracking, or camera motion estimation, and in numerous application domains, such as dynamic scene analysis, video surveillance, visual servoing for robots, video coding, or video indexing. Motion2D is an extended and optimized implementation of the robust, multi-resolution and incremental estimation method (exploiting only the spatio-temporal derivatives of the image intensity function) we defined several years ago (J.-M. Odobez and P. Bouthemy, Robust multiresolution estimation of parametric motion models. Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, 6(4):348-365, December 1995). Real-time processing is achievable for motion models involving up to 6 parameters (for 256x256 images). Motion2D can be applied to the entire image or to any pre-defined window or region in the image.
<p>
Motion2D is released in different versions:
<p>
<b>Motion2D Free Edition</b> is the version of Motion2D available for development of Free and Open Source software only (no commercial use). It is provided free of charge under the terms of the <a href="license.html">Q Public License</a>. It includes the source code and makefiles for Linux, Solaris, SunOS, and Irix. The latest version is available for  <a href="download.html">download</a>.
<p>
<b>Motion2D Professional Edition</b> provided for commercial software development. This version also supports Windows 95 and NT. It permits traditional commercial software distribution and includes free upgrades and Technical Support Service. For questions regarding purchase and pricing (royalties) for the Motion2D Professional Edition, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Motion2D@irisa.fr">Motion2D@irisa.fr</a>

 <h2>Motion2D authors</h2>

<p>
Motion2D was developed at <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/accueil/index_uk.htm">Irisa/INRIA Rennes</a> by the <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/vista/Vista.english.html">Vista team</a>.
<p>
The Motion2D authors are: Jean-Marc Odobez, <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/vista/Equipe/People/Patrick.Bouthemy.english.html">Patrick Bouthemy</a> and <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/vista/Equipe/People/Fabien.Spindler.english.html">Fabien Spindler</a>.
<p>
This software was initially developed by Jean-Marc Odobez during his PhD thesis under Patrick Bouthemy's supervision. Then, it was optimized and extended by Fabien Spindler.
<p>

 <br>
 <h2>Motion2D supported platforms</h2>

<p>
The Motion2D (Free and Professional Editions) library runs on Unix (Linux, SunOS, Solaris and Irix) operating systems. Currently we actively support the following combinations of operating systems and compilers, where g++ can be either egcs 2.91.x, g++ 2.8.x, g++ 2.95.x, g++ 2.96, g++ 3.0.4, g++-3.1, g++-3.2.x, g++-3.3.x or g++-3.4.x and where CC can be either CC-5.x or CC-7.3.x.
<p>
Moreover, the Motion2D Professional Edition library runs on Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT 4, Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Motion2D/Windows can be used with Cygwin g++ 2.95.x or Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. In that case, the distribution includes project files for Microsoft Visual C++ (.dsp files).
