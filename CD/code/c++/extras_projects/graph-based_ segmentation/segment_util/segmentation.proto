// Each spatio-temporal region is represented as a set of 2D frame-slices,
// associated by a unique id that is given to each region. Therefore, there 
// exists one SegmentationDesc for each frame in the original video.
// 2D Regions are saved similar to polygon rasterization or RLE, as set of 
// scanlines and the corresponding scanline intervals.
// As the hierarchy of regions (super-regions, i.e. regions composed of regions)
// is computed for the whole video volume, it would be redundant to store it at 
// every frame, it is therefore only saved for the very first frame, for all
// subsequent SegmentationDesc::hierarchy is empty.
