<h1> Motion2D Frequently Asked Questions </h1><br>

<p>

<p>
<br>

<p>
<ol>
<li> <b>What is IRISA? </b>
<p>
Irisa (<a href="http://www.irisa.fr">http://www.irisa.fr</a>) is a publicly funded research laboratory with a staff of 370, including 150 full-time research scientists or teaching research scientists and 115 postgraduate students. INRIA, the CNRS, the University of Rennes 1 and INSA Rennes are all partners in this mixed research unit.
<p>
Twenty research projects or actions are centered around four major scientific topics, i.e. networks and systems- software engineering and symbolic computation - man-machine interaction, images, data, knowledge - simulation and optimization of complex systems. These generic themes find their application in many fields, resulting in interdisciplinary cooperation with other leading professionals from both the academic and the industrial world, in areas such as telecommunications, multimedia, transport, genome science, emerging technologies applied to health, environment etc.
<p>
<li> <b> What is VISTA? </b>
<p>
Vista (<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/vista">http://www.irisa.fr/vista</a>) is one of the Irisa's research projects. Vista research work is concerned with image sequence analysis and active vision. More precisely, we address two broad issues: analysis of physical phenomena for providing image-based or scene-based motion-related measurements, and for investigating recognition and interpretation of temporal events; perception and control of automated or robot systems, for handling manipulation, tracking, navigation, surveillance or exploration tasks.
<p>
<li> <b>What kind of licenses exist for Motion2D? </b>
<p>
The Motion2D toolkit is available under two different licenses: The Professional Edition for commercial use, and the Free Edition for developing free/open source software under the Q Public License. There is more information about the QPL at the Trolltech web site (<a href="http://www.trolltech.com/qpl">http://www.trolltech.com/qpl</a>).
<p>
<li> <b>What are the differences between the Professional and the Free Edition of Motion2D?</b>
<p>
You may write commercial/proprietary/non-free software only if you have purchased the Professional Edition. The library itself is the same. With the commercial edition, you also get technical support and upgrades. Motion2D for Microsoft Windows is only available as Professional Edition.
<p>
<li> <b>I don't want to give away my source code. What do I do? </b>
<p>
Then you need the Motion2D Professional Edition.  Please contact <a href="mailto:Motion2D@irisa.fr">Motion2D@irisa.fr</a>
<p>
<li> <b>Can I charge for my application? </b>
<p>
If you have the Professional Edition: Yes, of course. If you use the Free Edition your software must be freely distributable and you must include the source.
<p>
The Free Edition is intended for free software. We realize that CD-ROMs cost money to produce, for example, so you can charge a copying fee.
<p>
<li> <b>Where can I find Motion2D? </b>
<p>
The latest version of Motion2D Free Edition can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/vista/Motion2D">http://www.irisa.fr/vista/Motion2D</a>
<p>
<li> <b>I want to port Motion2D to a new platform. What do I do? </b>
<p>
If the new platform is POSIX-like System, it's simple. Read the file PORTING for details.
<p>
<li> <b>I found a bug and I need it fixed! </b>
<p>
We try to support the developers using the Motion2D Free Edition as well, and we take all bug reports seriously, no matter who they come from. But, of course, when there's too much to do, our customers have higher priority.
<p>
<li> <b>What kind of image input/output are provided? </b>
<p>
The <a class="el" href="classCMotion2DImage.html">CMotion2DImage</a> class is only provided for convenience in order to build the Motion2D example programs. Therefore, image input/output manipulations are restricted and only supported for PNG and PNM file format. The different PNM formats are PGM P5 and PPM P6.
