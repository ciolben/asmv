BUG LIST
FIXED : On some videos, "access violation" shows at the first frame or at the very beginning when button "go" is pressed.
FIXED :	raw copy create "access violation", change it to memcopy for ffmpeg's frames to QImage.
FIXED : memory leak on QImage pointer.
FIXED : memory leak in FFMPEG decoder (frame's packet were not correctly freed).
FIXED  : cannot load DImage (from OpticalFlow lib) in QImage (need save 
to disk then read from disk as a workaround).

NOTE
CUDA : subproject is needed because cuda exe cannot be debugged 
(issue?). It would broke video player executable otherwise.
