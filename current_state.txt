Show frame by frame a video -> ok
Linear time control -> ok
B-Spline time control -> ok
Find frames of interest
	-implement opticalflow c2f -> if enough time
		-try "engine.h"
		-else use python script
	-implement opticalflow cuda (tk) -> ok
		-setup cuda 5.5 in qt 5.1 -> ok (no debug with qt)
		-setup opencv 2.4.6 in qt 5.1 -> ok (with debug)
		-interface for computing opticalflow (dll) (almost done, 
need to find correct image import format (jpg gives strange vertical 
lines when copied into cv::mat), however, the flow seems correct -> 
BUG*)

BUG LIST
FIXED : On some videos, "access violation" shows at the first frame or at the very beginning when button "go" is pressed.
FIXED :	raw copy create "access violation", change it to memcopy for ffmpeg's frames to QImage.
FIXED : memory leak on QImage pointer.
FIXED : memory leak in FFMPEG decoder (frame's packet were not correctly freed).
FIXED  : cannot load DImage (from OpticalFlow lib) in QImage (need save 
to disk then read from disk as a workaround).
BUG : see above *
BUG : packed QML files into qrc because it's not convenient to put them 
into a folder when distributing app.

NOTE
CUDA : subproject is needed because cuda exe cannot be debugged 
(issue?). It would broke video player executable otherwise.
OpenCV 2.4.6 recompiled with GPU and OpenGL support.
